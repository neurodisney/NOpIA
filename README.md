# NOpIA
This repository provides processing tools that are related to the analysis of data from optical imaging experiments with neuromodulators.

Be aware, this is work in progress and it is not guaranteed that the functions will work robustly.


## converting data

The first steps requires the conversion of optical imaging data into the nifti format.
